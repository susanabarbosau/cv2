        <td><h1>Susana Barbosa Upegui</h1><p>My name is Susana, I am 14 years old and I live in Medellín. I was named
after my grandmother, who is also called Susana and we were born on
the same day. I am very outgoing and talkative. I have brown hair and
brown eyes, and I love to paint my nails. All my family is from Medellin,
but my father is from Cali, so I also love salsa. My favorite food is French
fries and Coca Cola, but I also really like Ice Cream since I was little.</p></td>

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      I love music, I play the ukulele and drums, but I also like to sing. I like to
go to UN Models, where I debate with people from other schools. I like to
go to the gym after schools and on weekends. I love to see Netflix and
my favorite series is The Crown, in there they talk about the British
Monarchy. I like to go out with my friends on Fridays. I love going to karts
and I like to watch Formula 1 with my dad. I also love going to eat at
night with my family because we can talk with each other about how we
feel.

<h1>Celebrity Crush</h1>
<p>
  I have 2 celebrity crushes. My first one is called Juan Pablo Villamil, from
  Morat. He plays banjo and sings incredible. He has brown eyes and
  brown hair. My second crush is Tom Cruise, he has blue eyes and black
  hair. He is starring in my favorite movie, Top Gun. I like that they are
  masculine, and they treat good women. I also like their physical
  appearance because they dress really good and have a good style. They
  also are good people and talented.

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>
  I recommend you listen to Bruno Mars. He has variety in his music, from
  songs which you can dance, into ones that are sentimental and
  melancholic. “When I was your Man” Is a great song, as Bruno shows all
  his potential singing but also in the piano, hitting high notes. He is
  known for having a really high registry, which we can also see in “Versace on The Floor”, in this song he hits a song that is in a normal
registry for a women and even high for them. He is a great artist and
dancer.
